# Bodyfat-percentage-predictor-using-regression-in-python
This repository contains code to build a linear regression model in python to predict human bodyfat percentage.

The body fat percentage is a measure of fitness level, since it is the only body measurement which directly calculates 
a person's relative body composition without regard to height or weight. The dataset is focused on male bodyfat percentage.

**Model Type** : Linear Regression

**Dataset source** : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset

**Dataset column description** :

Density determined from underwater weighing   
Percent body fat from Siri's (1956) equation    
Age (years)   
Weight (lbs)   
Height (inches)   
Neck circumference (cm)    
Chest circumference (cm)    
Abdomen 2 circumference (cm)   
Hip circumference (cm)   
Thigh circumference (cm)   
Knee circumference (cm)   
Ankle circumference (cm)   
Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)   
Forearm circumference (cm)   
Wrist circumference (cm)   

**Evaluation Metrics** : Mean squared error, R-squared value   

**Libraries** : pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels

If you have any suggestions or find any issues with the model, contributions are welcome.
